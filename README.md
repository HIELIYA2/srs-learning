> BorSood is your solutoin for an effective learning!

### How does it work?

BorSood is a Spaced Repetiotin System (SRS).
Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards.
Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect.

### How to use it?

It's simple!
Add new cards of the new information you want to remember: term on one side and definition on the other.
Then, practice it -
every day you will get the relevant cards, the intervals for displaying a cards are getting higher as long as you remember them.
Once you forget, you start from the beginning.
After a while, you will be surprised to see how much you remember!

### Next steps

It is still WIP!
The roadmap is as followed:

- [x] make the app responsive
- [x] deploy
- [ ] connect Firebase authentication
- [ ] connect the DB
